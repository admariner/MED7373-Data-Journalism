## Module Synopsis

Data Journalism aims to facilitate a flexible and adaptable skillset, including the use of ‘computational thinking’ and communities of practice, that provides a basis for students to critically adapt to both new and existing data journalism techniques.

You will also be learning about other aspects of data journalism in sister modules, for example [the **Narrative** module](https://github.com/paulbradshaw/MED7334-Narrative/blob/master/README.md) will give you a range of skills for telling data-driven stories using video, audio, visual journalism, visualisation, and interactivity. In **Research in Practice** you will explore research around newsrooms. In **Specialist Reporting, Investigations and Coding** you will expand your coding and investigative skills, and in **Law, ethics, regulation and security** you will build your infosec skills.


## Outcomes

1. Identify, gather and communicate stories based on structured information using data journalism techniques and technologies for an identified audience
2.	Critically evaluate the professional, legal and ethical contexts surrounding data journalism and apply that to a specific project

## Week by week outline

This module begins with formal classes and becomes more student-driven as it progresses. You will be expected to **experiment with techniques ahead of sessions**, so that class time is spent more fruitfully in interactive discussion rather than one-way lectures.

You will also be expected to feed your own experiences into each class - and your own problems and questions - rather than coming to the sessions with nothing to contribute or build on. As independent learners the emphasis is on you to drive your learning forward through conversation rather than accept it passively.

## 1: Data journalism: it starts with an idea

By the end of this week you should be able to describe what data journalism is, and what types of stories you can find and tell with data journalism techniques. You should be able to generate ideas for data journalism stories yourself, and identify some sources of data. You will also be able to use GitHub to clone or fork a repo.
