# Workshop: applying styles to a story

This exercise demonstrates how CSS selectors work - and Codepen.

## Create an account on Codepen and create a new 'pen'

Create an account on [Codepen](https://codepen.io/) and create a new 'pen' (go to https://codepen.io/pen/ and then change the name in the upper left corner from 'untitled')

## Copy the text into Codepen

Here's the text you need to copy and paste into the HTML view in Copepen (it's from [this story](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-58085428)):

> 'NHS abandoned me after I tried to kill myself'
>
> A woman who tried to take her own life after suffering post-natal depression says she was abandoned by NHS mental health services during the pandemic.
>
> Katie Yelland, 30, relied on family support to get her through the first lockdown after services were paused.
>
> It comes as monthly mental health referrals across the UK hit their highest point in two years.
>
> Charities warned the surge was set to continue and called for action from the UK and devolved governments.
>
> The UK government says it plans to expand and transform mental health services, backed by Â£2.3bn a year by 2023-24.

## Add some HTML tags to separate it out

You will notice that in the preview underneath all the text is lumped into one paragraph. That's because we need to add **tags**.

Do the following:

* At the start of the headline, add a `<h1>` tag to indicate that this line is a level 1 heading
* At the end of the headline, add a `</h1>` tag to indicate the end of that heading
* At the start of each line after that, add a `<p>` tag to indicate the start of a paragraph
* At the end of each line, add a `</p>` tag to indicate the end of a paragraph

See the formatting of the preview underneath change as you add those tags.
