# R workshop exercises and directed study

Check out [10 things to do with R first](https://github.com/paulbradshaw/Rintro/blob/master/10thingstodofirst.md) in [my repo dedicated to R](https://github.com/paulbradshaw/Rintro/) and look at the other guides there including [10 *more* things you can do in R next](https://github.com/paulbradshaw/Rintro/blob/master/10morethings.md).

You can do any of the following workshops:

* [R exercises](https://github.com/paulbradshaw/MED7373-Data-Journalism/blob/master/R/Rexercises.md) including creating a variable, changing it, and working with vectors and data frames
* [Getting started with crime data](https://github.com/paulbradshaw/MED7373-Data-Journalism/blob/master/R/crimedata.md) shows how to import and merge datasets from two different areas, then create a filtered subset
* [Working with MPs' expenses to demonstrate R](https://github.com/paulbradshaw/MED7373-Data-Journalism/blob/master/R/Rcsvexample.md) uses similar processes, in more depth
* [A dentists story](https://github.com/paulbradshaw/MED7373-Data-Journalism/blob/master/R/workshop_dentists.md) takes you through importing, cleaning, merging, and exporting - but with some typical problem solving along the way
* [Analysing the gender pay gap: time and dates](https://github.com/paulbradshaw/genderpaygap/blob/master/r/timedategpg.Rmd) takes you through some techniques for working with time and date in R using the package `lubridate`
* [A directed study task](https://github.com/paulbradshaw/MED7373-Data-Journalism/blob/master/R/ds.md) provides some further ideas for exploration
