# Directed study: write a MAPPED! story

Identify a dataset which might have some sort of geographical dimension - it may be specific points, or administrative regions.

Examples include:

* [Crime and stop and search data on data.police.uk](https://data.police.uk/data/)
* [Election data](https://www.electoralcalculus.co.uk/flatfile.html) from the a previous election in the UK or elsewhere (e.g. looking ahead to the next one)
* [Crime reports by police authority from the Home Office](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/crime-statistics)
* [School spending or absences by local authority](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/statistics-local-authority-school-finance-data)
* [Food hygiene inspection data](https://data.food.gov.uk/catalog/datasets/38dd8d6a-5ab1-4f50-b753-ab33288e3200) - this will need converting to CSV so you'll need to find an [XML to CSV converter](https://www.convertcsv.com/xml-to-csv.htm) to do that first (useful experience!)

You'll [find plenty of examples in the datasets folder here](https://github.com/paulbradshaw/MED7373-Data-Journalism/tree/master/mapping/datasets)

Write a story about the data. Consider whether the map is there to show a pattern or distribution - or if it's exploratory (designed for users to explore). 

There are two genres of story which are most likely:

* A news story about change, ranking, the scale of something, or variation - where the map adds extra illustration
* An interactive feature where the map *is* the story. [Tips on writing that here](https://github.com/paulbradshaw/journalismrecipebook/blob/main/chapters/mapped.md)

Keep it simple!

Consider alternatives ways of visualising the data, or parts of it, e.g. bar charts or pie charts etc.

Publish, share on Slack.

Then spend time adding to it - try to get some quotes.
