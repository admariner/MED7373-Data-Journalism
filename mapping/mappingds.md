# Directed study: write a MAPPED! story

Identify a dataset which might have some sort of geographical dimension - it may be specific points, or administrative regions.

Examples include:

* Food hygiene inspection data
* Crime reports on data.police.uk
* Election data from the a previous election in the UK or elsewhere (e.g. looking ahead to the next one)
* Crime reports by police authority from the Home Office
* School spending or absences by local authority
* Health data by CCG (you'll probably need CCG shape files!) 

You'll [find plenty of examples in the datasets folder here](https://github.com/paulbradshaw/MED7373-Data-Journalism/tree/master/mapping/datasets)

Write a story about the data. Consider whether the map is there to show a pattern or distribution - or if it's exploratory (designed for users to explore). 

Keep it simple!

Consider alternatives ways of visualising the data, or parts of it, e.g. bar charts or pie charts etc.

Publish, share on Slack.

Then spend time adding to it - try to get some quotes.
